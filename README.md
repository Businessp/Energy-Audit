# Energy-Audit
Energy Audit can be defined as an inspection survey and an analysis of energy flows for energy conservation in a building.
It  is an official scientific study of energy consumption of an organisation/process/plant/equipment aimed at reduction of energy consumption and energy costs without affecting productivity and comforts and suggesting the methods for energy saving and reduction in energy cost.
Energy audit is carried out in planned, official manner by every energy intensive organisation/plant management.
It identifies the cost of energy and where and how it is used. It will identify the amount of energy expended in a process with the help of mass and energy balance for each process.
Types of Energy Audit:
The energy audit can be of following two types:
1. Preliminary audit.
2. Detailed audit.
1. Preliminary audit:
Preliminary audit is carried out in the limited time say within 10 days and it highlights the energy cost and wastages in the major equipment’s and processes.
The pre-audit visit is done, by the audit team/audit consultant, in the plant area with the attention focused on the energy inputs, spots of wastage and available energy conservation opportunities. The items for waste recycling opportunities are identified. The data regarding energy inputs and outputs are collected for use during preliminary audit.
After the pre-audit visit, the work of energy audit is undertaken. In the preliminary audit, low tech recommendations are preferred. High tech solutions are given un¬der detailed energy audit. Some of the low cost recommendations may be: Switching off lights when not required, replace incandescent lamps by the fluorescent lamps, automatic thermostat control, use of solar water heating panels etc.
2. Detailed (Comprehensive) Energy Audit:
Detailed energy audit, also known as com­prehensive energy audit includes engineering recommendations and well defined projects with priorities. The duration of such studies is generally from 1 to 10 weeks. The action plan in divided into short term, medium term and long term actions.
The short term action plan requires no capital investment or least investment to avoid energy wastages and minimizing non-essential energy uses and improving the system efficiency through improved maintenance programme.
The medium term action plan requires a little investment to achieve efficiency improve¬ment through modifications of existing equipment’s and other operations.
The long term action plan is aimed to achieve economy through latest energy saving tech¬niques and innovations. The capital investments are required to be studied thoroughly while finalizing the long term action-plan.
The comprehensive audit is quite exhaustive, and it is convenient to split it into following sub parts: 
1. Overall system audit: 
This accounts for energy leakage/loss through the total sys¬tem to the atmosphere. The energy conservation measures to eliminate such leak¬ages/loss are recommended. 
2. Functional audit:
It identifies the energy conservation measures in operation and maintenance of each main plant and its subsystems and suggests ECOs is operation and maintenance.
3. Utility Audit: 
It identifies yearly/monthly/daily consumption of commercial second¬ary energy (electricity/petroleum products/fuel etc.) and suggests ECOs
4. Modernization audit: 
It recommends major changes in the process requiring retro¬fitting.
